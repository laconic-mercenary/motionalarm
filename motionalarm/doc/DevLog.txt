TO DO [16 June 2011]
> verify streaming
> provide a "test" button in the speech dialog
> test appearance on Windows XP

TO DO [25 June 2011]
> was able to get streaming to fully work reliably
	- it can only use a tcp socket as the packets will not arive in order if using udp.
> changed icon set to use the GNU LGPL which means I can distribute this as proprietary software: google="lpgl icons"
> everything now is under the LGPL except the ImageGrabber...
	- this I will have to write myself somehow.  

[26 June 2011]
> have completely migrated over to the Lesser GPLv3 with AForge taking over the ImageGrabber
	as the one to use for capturing web camera images
> added a VideoPreferences window which allows configuration of the camera resolution
	and, can now choose the device to stream if there are multiple web cameras attached.
> bug:	sequence:
		started scanning regularly
		stopped the scan
		configured an ip address to stream
		enabled the stream (connected)
		worked
		stopped
		changed the resolution
		started the camera again
		noted that it was DETECTING, not streaming

[27 June 2011]
- fixed the bug described yesterday, set the isDetectionEnabled flag dependent on the streamChkBx.IsChecked property
TO DO:
> revise the logging messages to emphasize importances (APPLICATION STARTING -> application starting) [X]
> create some tests
	- using the camera (stress test the interface)
		> switch between resolutions while streaming
		> switch between streaming and detecting a few times
> do async email sending? [X]
> think about registration scheme

BUG:
> since transferring to the AForge web cam... have a problem with 
	the motion detector saying it is over threshold when you start the scanner.
	Trying to pause, between starting the web cam, and starting the detector 
	used to work, but not any more... (FIXED, implemented a TIMER)
> problem with the application hanging when the scanner is running and we click RESET (FIXED, lock() was causing the timer to wait)

[28 June 2011]
CODE SWEEP / ANALYSIS:
	- @scannerInitialize() : get rid of the CapDevice reference and use the Globals...
	- @scanner_OnImageREady() : get rid of the commented out crap
	- @buttonScanStart_Click() : get rid of the CapDevice reference and use Globals...
	- consider adding a Globals.areDevicesConnected() method
	- @imageGrabber_ImageCaptured() : get rid of the lock on the onCameraImageReady() call
TO DO:
	- if someone where to de-compile this, they would see the lambdaTestSender email password, come up with something 
		creative to prevent them from getting the password directly...
	- test what happens when you connect 2 devices together
NOTES:
	- made the scanner cool down time 5 seconds, this seems to work pretty well.

[ 3 Jul 2011 ]
Made some changes
	> got rid of the ImageStreamer
		- now instead of the user running e-motion having to connect to a remote client (i.e. having to know the 
		client's ip address, now the user running e-motion simply has to enable it with a password
		- the client must know the IP Address of the e-motion machine and the port to connect on.  
		- added class StreamManager to handle this on the e-motion side.

	> TEST CASES:
		(server = "e-motion", client = "stream receiver")

		Connection Established:
			Streaming:
				- press the connect button on the client for the 2nd time, see what happens
				- stop the scanner
				- reset the scanner
				- configure a new stream with a different password (with stream enabled)
				- configure a new stream with a different password (stream disabled)
				- close the client, then open it, then attempt to connect again
				- disable internet / network
			Non-Streaming:
				
		Connecting:
			- with stream enabled and configured, and the scanner running (images show up in scan pane)
				connect with client.
			- with stream enabled and configured, disable the servers stream, then connect with client
			- attempt to connect with no stream configured
			- attempt to connect with a stream configured but not enabled


[5 Jul 2011]
Will extend the main window a bit
	- adding a new group box (streaming):
		
[8 Jul 2011]
Successfully did the following:
	- implement an AutoReset Event in the StreamManager
		that makes the sending thread block peacefully until data is ready to be sent
	- replaced LED with LedIndicator, one that allows for animations on diodes.

[17 Jul 2011]
Do the following:
	- AppConfiguration class
	- Config static class (singleton)
	- reset the threshold progress bar when resetting or stopping to 0.0
	- do test cases
